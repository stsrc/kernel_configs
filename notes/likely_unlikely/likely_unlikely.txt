1. Branch predictor.

Staic branch prediction -
	* jump is always false and next instruction always executed (early SPARC and MIPS),
	* jump is always true for lower addresses, and false for higher addresses than current instruction address.
	* static branch prediction as a fall-back technique to the dynamic predictors (Pentium 4) 
	* All decisions made at compile time.


2. Branch target predictor - take jmp instruction and compute target address.

3. Delay slot - instruction slot that gets executed without the effects of a preceding instruction.

3. Dynamic branch prediction - 

	* Next line prediction?

 	* One-level branch prediction
	1-bit saturing counter - incremented when branch predicted correctly.
	2-bit saturing counter - 4 states. 00 - strongly not taken, 11 - strongly taken. 
	Incremented/decremented accordingly to the real life. Prediction is changed when conditional jump deviates twice from what it have done past. It seems to be better...
	Two-level predictor - table of 2-bit saturing counters. It's hard...

	Local branch prediction - it's...

	Global branch prediction - ...

	Alloyed branch prediction - ...
	
	Agree predictor - ...
